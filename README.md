# Neuraforge

**Neuraforge** is a cutting-edge, general-purpose agentic AI system designed from the ground up for maximum control, transparency, and adaptability. Built in **pure Python** (with optional future support for Rust/C++ extensions), it leverages **hand-coded neural networks** or **low-level PyTorch models**, explicitly avoiding the use of pretrained black-box models.

This project prioritizes **modularity**, **agentic reasoning**, **learnability**, and **performance**, creating an ideal platform for research, experimentation, and production-level AI applications without external model dependencies.


## Why Neuraforge?

Most modern AI systems rely heavily on pretrained, bloated models that sacrifice control and transparency for performance. Neuraforge flips this paradigm by:

- Giving developers full access to the **fundamental neural components**
- Empowering custom model design, training, and optimization from scratch
- Providing an **agentic framework** — capable of long-term memory, autonomous task execution, and sensory integration
- Staying **lightweight, interpretable, and hackable**

This is a system **built for creators** who want to understand what’s going on under the hood — not just use someone else’s model.


## Core Features

- **Pure Python Engine**: Written with clarity and transparency in mind, with no reliance on pretrained networks
- **Custom Neural Networks**: Fully modular MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, attention layers, and more, from scratch or using raw PyTorch
- **Agentic Architecture**: Agents with memory, planning, multi-step reasoning, tool-use capabilities, and inter-agent communication
- **Sensor Fusion Ready**: Optional integration with camera, LiDAR, audio, and text input streams
- **Training & Inference Tools**: Optimizers, schedulers, logging, metrics, and live model debugging
- **Optional Hardware Extensions**: Future support for Rust/C++ CUDA kernels, edge-device deployment, and custom microcontrollers
- **No Wrappers or GPT APIs**: You control every neuron.
  

## Architecture Overview
```bash
[ Input Streams ]
↓
[ Sensory Encoders (Vision/Text/Audio) ]
↓
[ Perception Modules (CNNs, RNNs, etc.) ]
↓
[ Memory Bank ] ←→ [World Model]
↓
[ Agent Core (Reasoning + Action Selection) ]
↓
[ Output Layer / Tool-Use / Speech / Actuation ]
```

Each component is plug-and-play. You can use your own architecture or swap out parts (e.g. vision encoder, memory layer) without changing the whole system.
