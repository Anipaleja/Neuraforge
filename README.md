# Neuraforge

**Neuraforge** is a cutting-edge, general-purpose agentic AI system designed from the ground up for maximum control, transparency, and adaptability. Built in **pure Python** (with optional future support for Rust/C++ extensions), it leverages **hand-coded neural networks** or **low-level PyTorch models**, explicitly avoiding the use of pretrained black-box models.

This project prioritizes **modularity**, **agentic reasoning**, **learnability**, and **performance**, creating an ideal platform for research, experimentation, and production-level AI applications without external model dependencies.


## Why Neuraforge?

Most modern AI systems rely heavily on pretrained, bloated models that sacrifice control and transparency for performance. Neuraforge flips this paradigm by:

- Giving developers full access to the **fundamental neural components**
- Empowering custom model design, training, and optimization from scratch
- Providing an **agentic framework** — capable of long-term memory, autonomous task execution, and sensory integration
- Staying **lightweight, interpretable, and hackable**

This is a system **built for creators** who want to understand what’s going on under the hood — not just use someone else’s model.


## Core Features

- **Pure Python Engine**: Written with clarity and transparency in mind, with no reliance on pretrained networks
- **Custom Neural Networks**: Fully modular MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, attention layers, and more, from scratch or using raw PyTorch
- **Agentic Architecture**: Agents with memory, planning, multi-step reasoning, tool-use capabilities, and inter-agent communication
- **Sensor Fusion Ready**: Optional integration with camera, LiDAR, audio, and text input streams
- **Training & Inference Tools**: Optimizers, schedulers, logging, metrics, and live model debugging
- **Optional Hardware Extensions**: Future support for Rust/C++ CUDA kernels, edge-device deployment, and custom microcontrollers
- **No Wrappers or GPT APIs**: You control every neuron.
  

## Architecture Overview
```bash
[ Input Streams ]
↓
[ Sensory Encoders (Vision/Text/Audio) ]
↓
[ Perception Modules (CNNs, RNNs, etc.) ]
↓
[ Memory Bank ] ←→ [World Model]
↓
[ Agent Core (Reasoning + Action Selection) ]
↓
[ Output Layer / Tool-Use / Speech / Actuation ]
```

Each component is plug-and-play. You can use your own architecture or swap out parts (e.g. vision encoder, memory layer) without changing the whole system.

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anipaleja/NeuraForge.git
cd neuraforge
```

2. Install dependencies

> Neuraforge keeps dependencies minimal and human-readable.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> By default, only pure Python is used. You can optionally install torch for low-level tensor ops:

```bash
pip install torch
```

3. Run your first agent
```bash
python main.py --mode basic
```

> This will initialize a simple agent and run it through a sandbox environment for debugging and demonstration.

### Configuration

All model parameters, training configs, and agent behaviors are defined via .yaml or .json files located in configs/.

Example:

```yaml
agent:
  name: ForgeBot
  memory: episodic
  reasoning: recurrent
  actions: [math, text_output]
model:
  type: MLP
  layers: [128, 256, 128]
  activation: relu
training:
  optimizer: sgd
  learning_rate: 0.001
  epochs: 100
```

## Examples
`examples/minimal_agent.py` – A fully custom agent using hand-coded MLPs

`examples/memory_test.py` – Agent with memory recall and state persistence

`examples/sensor_fusion.py` – Combine text, image, and simulated lidar inputs

`examples/low_level_torch.py` – Using raw torch without high-level helpers

## Future Roadmap
- Rust/C++ backend module for ultra-low-latency processing
- Multi-agent sandbox world for collaborative AI behavior
- Transformer-style reasoning from scratch
- Integration with simulated environments (Unity, Gym)
- Vector DB & retrieval-based memory
- Web control interface for live agent feedback

## Contributing
> Neuraforge is in early active development and we welcome contributors!

**Guidelines:**
- Keep code modular, readable, and commented
- Avoid any unnecessary dependencies
- Submit pull requests from feature branches
- Include tests for new modules

```bash
# Linting
flake8 neuraforge/
```
```bash
# Tests
pytest tests/
```

## Philosophical Principles
Neuraforge is based on a few key beliefs:

- You should understand your AI, not just prompt it
- Pretrained models limit creativity and transparency
- True AGI demands custom sensory processing and world modeling
- Tools should serve builders, not replace them

This project was inspired by the simplicity and beauty of early AI systems, modern agent frameworks like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, Warp, and Fosowl’s agenticSeek, and the belief that open, transparent AI should be created from first principles.
