# Neuraforge

**Neuraforge** is a cutting-edge, general-purpose agentic AI system designed from the ground up for maximum control, transparency, and adaptability. Built in **pure Python** (with optional future support for Rust/C++ extensions), it leverages **hand-coded neural networks** or **low-level PyTorch models**, explicitly avoiding the use of pretrained black-box models.

This project prioritizes **modularity**, **agentic reasoning**, **learnability**, and **performance**, creating an ideal platform for research, experimentation, and production-level AI applications without external model dependencies.

## ðŸŒŒ Why Neuraforge?

Most modern AI systems rely heavily on pretrained, bloated models that sacrifice control and transparency for performance. Neuraforge flips this paradigm by:

- Giving developers full access to the **fundamental neural components**
- Empowering custom model design, training, and optimization from scratch
- Providing an **agentic framework** â€” capable of long-term memory, autonomous task execution, and sensory integration
- Staying **lightweight, interpretable, and hackable**

This is a system **built for creators** who want to understand whatâ€™s going on under the hood â€” not just use someone elseâ€™s model.
